           The Ecma standard lists these design goals for C#:
           </p>
           <ul>
             <li>
The language is intended to be a simple, modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language;
</li>
<li>
The language, and implementations thereof, should provide support for software engineering principles such as strong type checking, array bounds checking,  detection of attempts to use uninitialized variables, and automatic garbage collection.  Software robustness, durability, and programmer productivity are important;
</li>
<li>
The language is intended for use in developing software components suitable for deployment in distributed environments;
</li>
<li>
Portability is very important for source code and programmers, especially those already familiar with C and C++;
</li>
<li>
Support for internationalization  is very important;
</li>
<li>
C# is intended to be suitable for writing applications for both hosted and embedded systems, ranging from the very large that use sophisticated operating systems, down to the very small having dedicated functions;
</li>
<li>
Although C# applications are intended to be economical with regard to memory and processing power requirements, the language was not intended to compete directly on performance and size with C or assembly language. 
</li>
</ul>

          <p>Microsoft first used the name C# in 1988 for a variant of the C language designed for incremental compilation. That project was not completed, and the name was later reused.
            </p>
            <p>The name "C sharp" was inspired by the musical notation whereby a sharp symbol indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch. This is similar to the language name of C++, where "++" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. The sharp symbol also resembles a ligature of four "+" symbols (in a two-by-two grid), further implying that the language is an increment of C++.

        <article>
        <p>The core syntax of the C# language is similar to that of other C-style languages such as C, C++ and Java, particularly:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Semicolons are used to denote the end of a statement;</li>
            <li>Curly brackets are used to group statements. Statements are commonly grouped into methods (functions), methods into classes, and classes into namespaces;</li>
            <li>Variables are assigned using an equals sign, but compared using two consecutive equals signs;</li>
            <li>Square brackets are used with arrays, both to declare them and to get a value at a given index in one of them.</li>
            </ul>

          <section class="main-section" id="Distinguishing_features">
        <header>Distinguishing features</header>
        <article>
          <p>Some notable features of C# that distinguish it from C, C++, and Java where noted, are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Portability
          </li>
          <p>By design, C# is the programming language that most directly reflects the underlying Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). Most of its intrinsic types correspond to value-types implemented by the CLI framework. Some C# compilers can also generate machine code like traditional compilers of C++ or Fortran.</p>
          <li>Typing
          </li>
          <p>C# supports strongly, implicitly typed variable declarations with the keyword var,  and implicitly typed arrays with the keyword new[] followed by a collection initializer.</p>
          <li>Metaprogramming
          </li>
          <p>Metaprogramming can be achieved in several ways:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reflection</li>
            <li>Expression trees</li>
            <li>Attributes</li>
            <li>System.Reflection.Emit namespace</li>
            <li>The .NET Compiler Platform (Roslyn)</li>
            <li>Source generators</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
          <li>Methods and functions
          </li>
          <p>A method in C# is a member of a class that can be invoked as a function (a sequence of instructions), rather than the mere value-holding capability of a field</p>
          <p>Like C++, and unlike Java, C# programmers must use the scope modifier keyword virtual to allow methods to be overridden by subclasses</p>
          <p>The type dynamic allows for run-time method binding, allowing for JavaScript-like method calls and run-time object composition.</p>
          <li>Property
          </li>
          <p>C# supports classes with properties. The properties can be simple accessor functions with a backing field, or implement getter and setter functions.</p>
          <li>Namespace
          </li>
          <p>A C# namespace provides the same level of code isolation as a Java package or a C++ namespace, with very similar rules and features to a package. Namespaces can be imported with the "using" syntax.</p>
          <li>Memory access
          </li>
          <p>In C#, memory address pointers can only be used within blocks specifically marked as unsafe, and programs with unsafe code need appropriate permissions to run. Most object access is done through safe object references, which always either point to a "live" object or have the well-defined null value; it is impossible to obtain a reference to a "dead" object (one that has been garbage collected), or to a random block of memory. An unsafe pointer can point to an instance of an unmanaged value type that does not contain any references to objects subject to garbage collections such as class instances, arrays or strings. Code that is not marked as unsafe can still store and manipulate pointers through the System.IntPtr type, but it cannot dereference them.</p>
          <li>Exception
          </li>
          <p>A range of standard exceptions are available to programmers. Methods in standard libraries regularly throw system exceptions in some circumstances and the range of exceptions thrown is normally documented. Custom exception classes can be defined for classes allowing handling to be put in place for particular circumstances as needed.</p>
          <li>Polymorphism
          </li>
          <p>Unlike C++, C# does not support multiple inheritance, although a class can implement any number of "interfaces" (fully abstract classes). This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complications and to simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI.</p>
          <li>Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
          </li>
          <p></p>
          <li>Functional programming
          </li>
          <p>C# has the ability to utilize LINQ through the .NET Framework. A developer can query a variety of data sources, provided IEnumerable T interface is implemented on the object. This includes XML documents, an ADO.NET dataset, and SQL databases.</p>
          </ul>

        <article>
          <p>CTS separates data types into two categories:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Reference types</li>
            <li>Value types</li>
            </ol>

          <section class="main-section" id="Boxing_and_unboxing">
        <header>Boxing and unboxing</header>
        <article>
           <p>Boxing is the operation of converting a value-type object into a value of a corresponding reference type. Boxing in C# is implicit.
          </p>
          <p>Unboxing is the operation of converting a value of a reference type (previously boxed) into a value of a value type. Unboxing in C# requires an explicit type cast. A boxed object of type T can only be unboxed to a T (or a nullable T).
          </p>
           <p>Example:
              </p>
              <code>
                int foo = 42;         // Value type.
object bar = foo;     // foo is boxed to bar.
int foo2 = (int)bar;  // Unboxed back to value type.
                </code>

        <article>
          <p>The C# specification details a minimum set of types and class libraries that the compiler expects to have available. In practice, C# is most often used with some implementation of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which is standardized as ECMA-335 Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).
          </p>
          <p>In addition to the standard CLI specifications, there are many commercial and community class libraries that build on top of the .NET framework libraries to provide additional functionality.
          </p>
          <p>C# can make calls to any library included in the List of .NET libraries and frameworks.
          </p>

        <article>
          <p>The following is a very simple C# program, a version of the classic "Hello world" example using the top-level statements feature introduced in C# 9:
          </p>
          <code
          >using System;

          Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
            </code>
            <p>For code written as C# 8 or lower, the entry point logic of a program must be written in a Main method inside a type:
              </p>
            <code>
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
            </code>
            <p>A Windows GUI example:
              </p>
              <code>
                using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        MessageBox.Show("Hello, World!");
        Console.WriteLine("Is almost the same argument!");
    }
}
                </code>
                <p>Images
              </p>
              <code>
                using System;
using System.Drawing;

public class Example
{
    public static Image img;

    static void Main()
    {
        img = Image.FromFile("Image.png");
    }
}
                </code>
